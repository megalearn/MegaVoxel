# Project overview

We are building a super-simple voxel model editor called "MegaVoxel".
The user can choose between 3 pre-configured colors (palette).
The user can choose between two modes: add/erase.

When creating a new model, the editor starts with a 9x9x9 block.
Each voxel should have the initail color of the first color in the palette.
The user can erase voxels to give stshape

## Usage

### Embedding

```
import { MegaVoxel } from megavoxel;
const editor = new MegaVoxel(
    palette: [0xff0000, 0x00ff00, 0x0000ff]
    onModelUpdated: ...
);
scene.add(editor);
```

### Export

The output format is JSON.

```
{
    palette: ["0xff0000", "0x00ff00", "0x0000ff"],
    voxels: [
        {x: .., y: .., z: .., color: 0},
        {x: .., y: .., z: .., color: 1},
        {x: .., y: .., z: .., color: 2},
    ]
}
```

## Tech Stack

- TypeScript
- ThreeJS
- Vite

No other dependencies.

## Input

- Color picker consisting of 3 on-screen buttons
- Mode picker (add/erase)
- Mouse click/touch to add/remove voxels
- Right-mouse button + drag rotates the camera around the center/model

The editor should have a similar feel to building things in Minecraft.

## Output

A single static megavoxel.html and megavoxel.js file.
